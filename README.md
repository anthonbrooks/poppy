# Poppy

Poppy is a web app made with Sinatra/Ruby. Users can sign up to leave reviews on their favorite movies and view reviews left by others. 

## Installation

clone the git repo to your local machine 

execute this command: 

  $ shotgun
      $ bundle

  
go to the url provided by shotgun (usually localhost:9393 or 127.0.0.1:9393)

## Usage

Users can sign up and leave/view reviews

In the future I want to add comments and direct messages. Also the ability for friends to set up movie dates.
